27. What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?
Ans. In OOP terminology, the creation of a new instance of the class is called instantiation. 
Memory is allocated for that object and the class constructor runs. Programmers 
can instantiate objects on the heap with a new keyword or on the stack as a variable 
declaration. Whenever an object of that class is instantiated, the compiler will 
call special class members.
