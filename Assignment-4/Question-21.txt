21. What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in python.
Ans. In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses 
objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, 
polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the 
data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the 
code can access this data.

OOPs Concepts in Python:-
-> Class
-> Objects
-> Polymorphism
-> Encapsulation
-> Inheritance
-> Data Abstraction

-> Multiple Inheritance in python is a well-known feature that is supported by all the major 
object-oriented programming languages. It can be described as a process where the child class 
or object inherits the methods and attributes from one or more parent classes.
