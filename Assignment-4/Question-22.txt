22. How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class.
Ans. Python is an object oriented programming language.
-> Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
-> A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
-> To create a class, use the keyword class.
Example:-
class MyClass:
  x = 5

-> Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the 
attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given 
arguments. The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the 
@ syntax to refer to instance attributes. 

Example:-
# define a class
class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0

# create object of class
bike1 = Bike()

# access attributes and assign new values
bike1.gear = 11
bike1.name = "Mountain Bike"

print(f"Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} ")
