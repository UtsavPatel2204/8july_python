1. What is List? How will you reverse a list?
Ans. List:-
-> Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
-> Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
-> Lists are created using square brackets [].
Reversing a list using the slicing technique:-
-> In this technique, a copy of the list is made, and the list is not sorted in place. Creating a copy requires more space to hold all the existing elements. This exhausts more memory. Here we are using the slicing technique to reverse our list in Python.
Example:-
-> def Reverse(lst):
     new_lst = lst[::-1]
     return new_lst
     lst = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
     print(Reverse(lst))
