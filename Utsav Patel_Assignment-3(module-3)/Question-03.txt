3. Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
Ans. In Python, there are two ways to add elements to a list: extend() and append(). However, these two methods 
serve quite different functions. In append() we add a single element to the end of a list. In extend() we add multiple 
elements to a list. The supplied element is added as a single item at the end of the initial list by the append() method. 
When an Iterable is supplied as a parameter, the extend() method adds each element from the Iterable to the listâ€™s end 
individually. It alters the initial list.
