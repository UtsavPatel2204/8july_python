1. Lists are mutable	                                1. Tuples are immutable
2. The implication of iterations is          2. The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
Time-consuming.
3. The list is better for performing 	   3. A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
operations, such as insertion 
and deletion.
4. Lists consume more memory.	   4.Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
