3. Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is usedfor? 
Ans. Both -django-admin and manage.py are the command-line tools that Django offers for operating and interacting with Django projects.
=>The --django-admin tool:
-> The command-line utility tool for administrative tasks is called django-admin. It performs administrative tasks related to Django, such as starting a Django project or creating a new Django app. It can also execute management commands offered by Django or third-party packages.
-> However, Django must be installed globally for django-admin to be accessible from anywhere on your system.
=>The manage.py tool:
-> Similarly, manage.py is also a command-line utility for Django projects. When you use the startproject command, each Django project includes a Python script called manage.py file that is generated automatically. It is placed in the root directory of the current project. It serves the same function as django-admin and sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to point to the projectâ€™s settings.py file.
