5. What is a QuerySet?Write program to create a new Post object in database. 
Ans. 
-> A QuerySet is a collection of data from a database.
-> A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects.
-> QuerySets makes it easier to get the data you actually need, by allowing you to filter and order the data at an early stage.

-> Create object
This is how you create a new Post object in database:

command-line
>>> Post.objects.create(author=me, title='Sample title', text='Test')
But we have one missing ingredient here: me. We need to pass an instance of User model as an author. How do we do that?

-> Let's import User model first:

command-line
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
What users do we have in our database? Try this:

command-line
>>> User.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<User: ola>]>
-> This is the superuser we created earlier! Let's get an instance of the user now (adjust this line to use your own username):

command-line
>>> me = User.objects.get(username='ola')
As you can see, we now get a User with a username that equals 'ola'. Neat!

-> Now we can finally create our post:

command-line
>>> Post.objects.create(author=me, title='Sample title', text='Test')
<Post: Sample title>

command-line
>>> Post.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Post: my post title>, <Post: another post title>, <Post: Sample title>]>
There it is, one more post in the list!
