4. What is Django URLs? Make program to create django urls.
Ans. A URL is a web address. You can see a URL every time you visit a website â€“ it is visible in your browser's address bar. (Yes! 127.0.0.1:8000 is a URL! And https://djangogirls.org is also a URL.)
-> Every page on the Internet needs its own URL. This way your application knows what it should show to a user who opens that URL. In Django, we use something called URLconf (URL configuration). URLconf is a set of patterns that Django will try to match the requested URL to find the correct view.
==> URLs
-> Create a file named urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file, and type this code in it:
my_tennis_club/members/urls.py:

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('members/', views.members, name='members'),
]
-> The urls.py file you just created is specific for the members application. We have to do some routing in the root directory my_tennis_club as well. This may seem complicated, but for now, just follow the instructions below.

-> There is a file called urls.py on the my_tennis_club folder, open that file and add the include module in the import statement, and also add a path() function in the urlpatterns[] list, with arguments that will route users that comes in via 127.0.0.1:8000/.

-> Then your file will look like this:

my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club/urls.py:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('members.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
 
 
If the server is not running, navigate to the /my_tennis_club folder and execute this command in the command prompt:
py manage.py runserver
