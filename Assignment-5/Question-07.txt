7. Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for? 
Ans. 
===> makemessages
django-admin makemessages
Runs over the entire source tree of the current directory and pulls out all strings marked for translation. It creates (or updates) a message file in the conf/locale (in the Django tree) or locale (for project and application) directory. After making changes to the messages files you need to compile them with compilemessages for use with the builtin gettext support. See the i18n documentation for details.

This command doesn’t require configured settings. However, when settings aren’t configured, the command can’t ignore the MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT directories or include LOCALE_PATHS.

--all, -a
Updates the message files for all available languages.

--extension EXTENSIONS, -e EXTENSIONS
Specifies a list of file extensions to examine (default: html, txt, py or js if --domain is js).
